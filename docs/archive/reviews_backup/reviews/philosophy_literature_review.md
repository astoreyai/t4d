**Key Findings:**
- The paper's 10 existing citations are accurate and well-chosen foundational works
- Several major gaps exist in coverage of contemporary philosophy of AI literature
- 15 additional citations recommended to strengthen philosophical grounding
- Extended Mind thesis (Clark & Chalmers) is notably absent despite direct relevance
- Recent LLM-specific philosophical literature (2023-2024) should be incorporated

## 6. Synthesis and Recommendations

### 6.1 Overall Assessment

The paper presents a thoughtful philosophical analysis of AI memory systems. The existing citations are accurate and include foundational works. However, several significant gaps exist:

1. **The Extended Mind thesis is the most critical omission** - Clark & Chalmers's argument that cognitive processes can extend into the environment directly parallels the paper's Continuity Criterion.

2. **Contemporary LLM philosophy is underrepresented** - Recent work by Bender, Hicks, and Butlin directly addresses the epistemological and phenomenological status of language model systems.

3. **The embodiment discussion lacks philosophical grounding** - Dreyfus's Heideggerian critique and Chemero's radical embodied cognition would strengthen Section 3.

4. **Personal identity discussion is incomplete** - Parfit's refinements of Lockean memory theory and his discussion of psychological continuity are directly relevant.

### 6.2 Structural Recommendations

1. **Add a section on symbol grounding** - The intentionality discussion would benefit from engagement with Harnad's symbol grounding problem.

2. **Expand consciousness discussion** - The Tulving reference is appropriate but Butlin et al.'s recent work provides a more rigorous framework.

3. **Engage with both sides of intentionality debate** - Currently only Searle is cited; adding Dennett's intentional stance would provide balance.

### 6.3 Citation Balance

**Current balance:**
- Classic philosophy (60%): Locke, Gettier, Searle, McCarthy/Hayes
- Cognitive science (20%): Bartlett, Tulving, McGaugh
- Contemporary AI (20%): Lewis, Packer, Park

**Recommended balance after additions:**
- Classic philosophy (40%): Locke, Gettier, Searle, Parfit, Dreyfus
- Contemporary philosophy of AI (30%): Clark/Chalmers, Floridi, Hicks, Butlin, Dennett
- Cognitive science (20%): Bartlett, Tulving, McGaugh, Schacter
- Contemporary AI (10%): Lewis, Packer, Park
