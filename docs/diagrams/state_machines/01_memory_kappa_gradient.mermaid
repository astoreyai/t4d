    direction LR

    [*] --> Raw: encode()

    Raw: κ = 0.0 (Just encoded, high volatility)
    Replayed: κ ~ 0.15 (NREM strengthened)
    Transitional: κ ~ 0.4 (Being abstracted)
    Semantic: κ ~ 0.85 (Prototype created)
    Stable: κ = 1.0 (Permanent knowledge)
    Decayed: κ < 0.05 (Candidate for GC)

    Raw --> Replayed: NREM phase<br/>κ += 0.05/cycle
    Replayed --> Transitional: NREM continues<br/>κ > 0.3
    Transitional --> Semantic: REM clustering<br/>prototype creation
    Semantic --> Stable: Repeated access<br/>κ → 1.0

    Raw --> Decayed: No access<br/>time decay
    Replayed --> Decayed: Low importance<br/>no retrieval
    Decayed --> [*]: PRUNE phase<br/>delete()

    Semantic --> Transitional: Reconsolidation<br/>new evidence
