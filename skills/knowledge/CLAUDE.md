**Path**: `/mnt/projects/t4d/t4dm/skills/knowledge/`

## What
Knowledge management skills for navigating and retrieving information from T4DM's codebase and documentation.

## How
- SKILL.md files defining retrieval strategies and knowledge indexing approaches

## Why
T4DM is a large codebase with dense scientific references. These skills help locate relevant code, docs, and research efficiently.

## Key Files
| Skill | Directory | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **ww-knowledge** | `ww-knowledge/SKILL.md` | Codebase knowledge indexing and navigation |
| **ww-retriever** | `ww-retriever/SKILL.md` | Targeted information retrieval from docs and code |

## Data Flow
```
Query → Knowledge skill → Codebase/docs search → Relevant context
```

## Integration Points
- **Docs**: Indexes content from `docs/` directory
- **Memory skills**: Shares retrieval patterns with memory category
